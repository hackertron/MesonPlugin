# About
This is some basic Meson buildsystem integration for Qt Creator.

Currently implemented features:
- Create new projects
- Show files in project:
  - Explicitly marked file lists
  - Other files
  - Subdirectories
  - Subprojects
  - Automatially shows coresponding header files (.h, .hpp, .hh, _p variants)
- Add/Remvoe/Rename files in explicitly marked file lists
- Basic build integration (ninja backend only):
- Extract C++ code completion information from compile_commands.json

Not yet implemented:
- Group files by target
- Edit build directory configuration
- Automatically detect (or create) build directory for existing projects
- Kit support
- meson.build syntax highlighting/code completion
- Asychronous meson introspection / project parsing

# How to create editable file groups
To enable editing a file list directly from the project explorer it needs to be marked with a marker comment.
It looks like this: `#ide:editable-filelist`.
Usage example:
```
#ide:editable-filelist
sources = [
  'bar.cpp',
  'foo.cpp',
]
```

# Building from source

Please note that the build was only tested with Qt Creator 4.6.0 and other versions most likely won't work as the Qt Creator APIs tend to change even between minor version.

To build the plugin you need the qtcreator sources and libraries. So the safest way is to also build qtcreator from source.

Rough steps:

```
# Optional:
#export LLVM_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/llvm
# useful on debian's stock qt
export QT_SELECT=5

wget http://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/4.6/4.6.0/qt-creator-opensource-src-4.6.0.tar.xz
tar -xf qt-creator-opensource-src-4.6.0.tar.xz
mkdir qt-creator-opensource-src-4.6.0-build
cd qt-creator-opensource-src-4.6.0-build

qmake -r ../qt-creator-opensource-src-4.6.0
make -j 6

cd /path/to/qtcreator-meson-plugin
